    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of those rare recipes that comes together so quickly and somehow still rivals a restaurant-quality meal. It is a recipe that, once you make it, you say: I will probably make these chicken tinga tacos every time I have friends over because it makes me look fancy with minimal effort. You also say: I need to memorize this recipe. You also say: How soon is too soon to make these again.</p> 
    <p>It is a miracle and a delight. A perfect taco unicorn.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup roughly chopped sweet onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1–2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>3⁄4 cup canned crushed fire-roasted tomatoes</li>
        <li>1⁄4 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded cooked chicken (rotisserie chicken works!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium. Once warm, add the oil and onion. Sauté for 4 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally. Add in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Stir in the chipotles, oregano, and cumin, and toast for 1 minute. Add in the tomatoes, stock, and salt. Bring to a simmer, and cook for 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the tomato mixture in a high-powered or regular blender, and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Return the blended sauce to the pan over low heat. Add the chicken, and cook for 5 minutes. Taste and add more salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>Prepare the garnishes. To assemble, top the tortillas with the chicken and garnish with the avocado slices, cilantro, red onion, and cotija. Serve with a lime wedge for squeezing.</li>
       </ol>
