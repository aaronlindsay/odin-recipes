    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Smoky, sweet, spicy, and tangy, esquites are the off-the-cob version of elotes—grilled on-the-cob Mexican street corn slathered with creamy, cheesy, lime-scented, chile-flecked sauce.</p> 
    <p>Elotes are a staple on my balcony grill over the summer. It's about as easy and inexpensive a dish as you can think of, and there is nothing—really, nothing—that'll get snatched up and eaten as fast as a hot plate of 'em. I'll usually count on making at least an ear and a half per person.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 ears fresh corn, shucked, kernels removed (about 3 cups fresh corn kernels)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 ounces (60g) feta or Cotija cheese, finely crumbled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely sliced scallions, green parts only</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1/2 ounce) fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and stemmed, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 to 2 medium cloves garlic, pressed or minced on a Microplane grater (about 1 to 2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) fresh lime juice from 1 lime</li>
        <li>Chile powder or hot chile flakes, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over high heat until shimmering. Add corn kernels, season to taste with salt, toss once or twice, and cook without moving until charred on one side, about 2 minutes. Toss corn, stir, and repeat until charred on second side, about 2 minutes longer. Continue tossing and charring until corn is well charred all over, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add cheese, scallions, cilantro, jalapeño, garlic, mayonnaise, lime juice, and chile powder and toss to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and more chile powder to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
